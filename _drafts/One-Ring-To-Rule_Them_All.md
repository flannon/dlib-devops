Is an open source devops possible?

the fedora and archivesspace developers communities all share a common language

I woulnd't try to popose a single standard, rather I'd like to try and outline a workign methodology that might lead towards the possibility of the standardization of practice.  ok, ok, that's all a bit lofty, a better way to describe this is this is how I do things

single source vagrant

Minimal shell provisioners

everything installed from puppet

build from the ground up.
